# Umbrella CLI

`./scripts/rae.sh` is the repository entrypoint. It validates the runtime
before dispatching to the package that owns each command.

## Command ownership

| Command | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify` | `scripts/verify.sh` | Run repository verification |
| `doctor` | `scripts/rae.sh` | Check runtime versions, tools, and entrypoints |
| `agent` | orchestration autonomous CLI | Run, inspect, stop, or resume an autonomous workflow |
| `operator serve` | orchestration operator console | Serve the loopback console for allowlisted repositories |
| `task route` | evaluation router | Select a runtime for one task specification |
| `checkpoint` | evaluation checkpoint CLI | Create or resolve an operator checkpoint |
| `orchestrate` | orchestration stage runner | Manage pipeline stages, artifacts, gates, and summaries |
| `worktree` | orchestration worktree CLI | Create, inspect, resume, or clean isolated runs |
| `ralph` | Ralph package | Run audit, linting, or story-scoped fixing |
| `hygiene` | repository hygiene tools | Run an explicitly selected maintenance utility |
| `eval` | evaluation CLI | Validate, execute, compare, calibrate, or gate benchmark evidence |
| `release-gate` | evaluation release gate | Check release-blocking regression evidence |
| `workflow` | umbrella aliases | Use task-oriented aliases for the same package commands |

Run:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh --help
```

Subcommand options are owned by the selected runtime:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh agent --help
./scripts/rae.sh orchestrate --help
./scripts/rae.sh ralph --help
./scripts/rae.sh eval --help
```

## Diagnostics

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh doctor
```

The command enforces:

- GNU Bash 5.3 or newer
- Python 3.14.6 or newer
- a supported Node.js version
- `git`, `rg`, `jq`, and `shellcheck`
- runnable package entrypoints

Optional documentation and maintenance tools are reported without failing the
core diagnostic.

Provider-backed autonomous work has a separate diagnostic:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh agent doctor
```

It requires authentication, workspace sandboxing, JSON-schema output, event
streaming, and ephemeral sessions.

## Autonomous run

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh agent run \
  --project-root /path/to/target-repository \
  --task "Implement the change, add regression tests, and update the documentation"
```

The default run creates `pipeline/<run-id>` under
`.git/rae-worktrees/<run-id>`. It prints the worktree and run-report paths.
Use `--through plan` to stop before mutation and `--checkpoint-policy` to add
operator decisions at protected boundaries.

Resume after correcting an environmental failure:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh agent resume \
  --project-root /path/from/the-run-output \
  --run-id <run-id>
```

RAE does not expose commit, push, publish, or deploy actions. Supported runs
reject protected Git-state changes.

## Operator console

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh operator serve \
  --project /canonical/path/to/target-repository
```

Repeat `--project` for additional allowlisted roots. The server binds to
loopback and prints an ephemeral token in the URL fragment. The console starts
only isolated-worktree runs and does not expose arbitrary commands, environment
overrides, in-place execution, Git publication, or deployment.

## Task routing and evaluation

Route one task:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh task route \
  --task-spec evals/datasets/tool-selection/tool-selection-core.task-specs.json \
  --task-id tool-selection-dev-orchestration \
  --output evals/results/local/planned-route.json
```

Run one benchmark split:

```bash
./scripts/rae.sh eval run \
  --benchmark-card evals/benchmarks/tool-selection-core.benchmark-card.json \
  --split dev \
  --output-dir evals/results/local-dev
```

The evaluation CLI also provides metadata validation, autonomous outcomes,
paired outcome comparison, policy optimization, suite execution, judge
calibration, and release gates. Run `./scripts/rae.sh eval --help` before using
an outcome or optimization command because those commands have explicit
provider and isolation requirements.

## Workflow aliases

- `workflow autonomous` forwards to `agent`
- `workflow repo-audit` forwards common audit operations to Ralph
- `workflow long-horizon` forwards to staged orchestration
- `workflow hygiene` forwards to repository hygiene tools

Aliases do not define independent behavior. The package command remains the
source of truth.

## Exit behavior

`rae.sh` rejects unknown command families and propagates the selected runtime's
exit status. A command that cannot establish its required safety boundary fails
closed.
