# Orchestration CLI

The workflow engine has three command surfaces:

| Surface | Entrypoint | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous workflow | `npm run rae -- agent ...` | Repository planning, changes, checks, and handoff |
| Stage runner | `npm run rae -- orchestrate ...` | Explicit pipeline state, stages, artifacts, gates, and summaries |
| Worktree lifecycle | `npm run rae -- worktree ...` | Isolated run creation, inspection, resume, and cleanup |

## Autonomous workflow

```bash
npm run rae -- agent doctor
npm run rae -- agent run \
  --project-root /path/to/target-repository \
  --task "Implement the change and verify it"
```

The default run uses `.git/rae-worktrees/<run-id>`. `--through plan` stops
before mutation. `--checkpoint-policy before-mutation-and-ship` pauses before
the first writable stage and before the final release decision.

Run `npm run rae -- agent --help` for run, resume, status, stop, checkpoint,
and event options.

## Stage runner

```bash
npm run rae -- orchestrate init
npm run rae -- orchestrate run-stage --run-id <run-id> --phase arm
npm run rae -- orchestrate summarize-run --run-id <run-id> --format markdown
```

`run-stage` is a low-level artifact and gate interface. Without an input
artifact it produces deterministic fixtures; it does not modify application
code.

The stage order is:

```text
arm
design
adversarial-review
plan
pmatch
build
quality-static
quality-tests
post-build
release-readiness
```

## Worktree lifecycle

```bash
npm run rae -- worktree --help
```

Worktree mode owns the `pipeline/<run-id>` branch, isolated checkout, run
state, and cleanup checks. Cleanup is explicit and refuses uncertain or active
state.
