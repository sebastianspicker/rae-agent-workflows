# Terminology

- `artifact`
  Structured output emitted by a stage, loop, or evaluation run.
- `gate`
  A decision record stating whether progression is acceptable.
- `claim`
  A statement that must be either evidenced, explicitly limited, or marked as
  provisional.
- `assumption`
  A condition accepted for now but expected to be re-checked when scope,
  implementation, or benchmarks change.
- `benchmark`
  A versioned task family with defined splits, scoring, and result reporting.
- `benchmark card`
  Metadata record for a benchmark family and its publication constraints.
- `run card`
  Metadata record for one benchmark execution.
- `judge`
  The scoring mechanism, human or model-assisted, used to evaluate outputs.
- `contamination`
  Leakage from benchmark tasks or solutions into model training or evaluation input
  conditions that inflates scores.
- `deterministic loop`
  A runner whose state transitions and story selection rules are explicit and
  reproducible.
- `orchestration`
  A staged workflow that separates intake, design, build, and verification into
  bounded phases.
- `Codex subagent`
  A delegated collaborator inside one native Codex task. It is distinct from a
  RAE node, which starts a fresh durable `codex exec` session.
- `node instance`
  One immutable execution of a logical workflow node, optionally bound to a
  stable mapped-item key.
- `execution tier`
  A workflow-owned logical request for economy, standard, or judgment work. An
  operator-owned execution profile resolves it to a named Codex or OpenCode
  route without placing provider configuration in the workflow.
- `execution route`
  An operator-owned executor and model mapping selected by a logical tier or a
  node-specific override. Routes are stored in execution profile 3.0, not in
  workflow revisions.

## Thesis validation

Shared terminology is part of the repo's control surface: stable vocabulary
reduces ambiguity between runtime behavior, benchmark interpretation, and
governance claims.

## Interpretation limits

- terminology improves auditability, but strong definitions do not replace
  evidence
