# Contracts and Gates

Contracts and gates are distinct control surfaces and should stay distinct.

## Claim

Structural validity and progression are different decisions. Keeping them
separate is what makes a gate auditable.

## 1. Contract

A contract says what an artifact must contain and how it should be interpreted.

Typical contract dimensions:

- syntax or schema
- required fields
- semantic field meanings
- provenance requirements

## 2. Gate

A gate says whether the current artifact is sufficient for progression under a
specific decision rule.

Gate outputs depend on the execution path:

- legacy ten-phase pipeline: `pass`, `warn`, `fail`; `warn` always advances and
  only `fail` blocks
- graph workflow (default): `passed` or `failed`

## 3. Why the distinction is mathematically useful

You can think of the contract as a predicate over structure and the gate as a
decision function over both structure and adequacy:

$$
\operatorname{contract\_valid}(A) \in \{\text{true}, \text{false}\}
$$

$$
\operatorname{gate}(A) \in
\begin{cases}
\{\text{pass}, \text{warn}, \text{fail}\} & \text{legacy} \\
\{\text{passed}, \text{failed}\} & \text{graph}
\end{cases}
$$

So an artifact can be:

- contract-valid but strategically weak
- contract-valid but not release-worthy
- locally useful but not benchmark-publishable

That separation is essential for serious documentation and evaluation.

## Repo implication

RAE uses contracts to define artifact shape and interpretation, then uses gates
to block progression or publication when evidence is still weak.

## Interpretation limits

- trivial local workflows may collapse these two ideas into one operator choice
- the gate outcomes and thresholds remain implementation-specific policy
