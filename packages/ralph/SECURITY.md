# Security Policy

## Supported Scope

Security issues are accepted for:

- `src/*.ts`
- PRD/runtime validation and path/scope enforcement logic
- bundled assets: `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `prd.schema.json`, and `prd.json.example`

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Follow the [repository security policy](../../SECURITY.md) for private
reporting instructions.

When reporting, include:

- affected file(s)
- impact summary
- reproduction steps
- expected vs actual behavior
- suggested mitigation (optional)

## What Is Considered Security-Relevant Here

- path traversal or path escape
- report write outside repository boundary
- scope bypass in `fixing` mode
- lock/race conditions causing unsafe concurrent mutation
- secret leakage into logs/reports
- unsafe default behavior that weakens containment

## Secure Defaults in This Template

- `audit` and `linting` are read-only
- report target path is validated and repository-confined
- `fixing` providers edit an external workspace, not the live checkout
- fixing pointers, journals, and baselines are outside provider workspace and
  temp writable roots
- fixing metadata is bound to canonical root/runtime identities
- promotion atomically quarantines an existing entry before validating it
- promotion and recovery install entries with native no-clobber renames
- concurrent target entries are preserved and conflict evidence is retained
- recovery touches only paths named by the transaction journal and evidence
- Codex runs with an exact child-environment allowlist
- raw output and final report size are bounded
- optional security preflight warns/fails on sensitive env vars
- runtime logs redact common secret/token patterns

## Hardening Recommendations for Consumers

- keep `RALPH_STRICT_REPORT_DIR=true`
- keep `RALPH_SECURITY_PREFLIGHT=true`
- enable `RALPH_SECURITY_PREFLIGHT_FAIL_ON_RISK=true` in stricter environments
- run in isolated CI runners for untrusted repositories
- avoid passing unnecessary secrets into the execution environment
- do not use hardlinks, special files, nested repositories, or submodules in a fixing target

The filesystem transaction is recoverable across multiple paths, not globally
atomic. Live traversal and renames are anchored to validated directory
descriptors, and journaled sibling operations bind the parent identity. Native
no-clobber rename support is required; unsupported platforms fail closed.

## Disclosure Process

- Maintainers triage and confirm impact
- A fix is prepared and tested
- Documentation and tests are updated
- Public disclosure follows after a fix is available
